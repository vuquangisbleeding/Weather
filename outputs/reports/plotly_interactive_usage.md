# Guide: Using the Interactive Plotly Chart

1. Install Plotly if not already installed:
   ```bash
   pip install plotly
   ```

2. Run the interactive visualization script:
   ```bash
   python plotly_interactive_weather.py
   ```

3. A browser window will open, displaying the temperature chart by date:
   - **Select data range:** Use the range slider below the time axis to choose the date range to view.
   - **Quick select:** Use the "1m", "6m", "1y", "all" buttons above the slider for quick navigation.
   - **Interact:** You can zoom, pan, and hover to see detailed values for each data point.
   - **Toggle variables:** If there are multiple variables (e.g., add humidity_percent), click the legend to show/hide each variable.

4. To add other variables (e.g., humidity_percent), edit plotly_interactive_weather.py and change the y or color column.
